    "- Use what we've learned in class and from the book to describe how one could set Target's problem up as a predictive modeling problem, such that they could have gotten the results that they did.  Formulate your solution as a proposed plan using our data science terminology.  Include all the aspects of the formulation that you see as relevant to solving the problem.  Be precise but concise."

    "I Goal:\n",
    "Predict whether or not a woman is pregnant\n",
    "\n",
    "II Predictive Model Attributes:\n",
    "Below are a few attributes I've taken into consideration to come to a conclusion about the model I would like to use for this scenario:\n",
    "1) Classification\n",
    "Since there are two possible answers to our question I would like to use a classification model and predict P(Y|X) where\n",
    "Y = Pregnant/Not Pregnant        and          X = Items bought from Target\n",
    "2) Discriminative\n",
    "As Target, already, has abundant data which can be used to make the calculate P(Y|X) instead of, indirectly, estimating P(X|Y) first and then using it to come to estimate P(Y|X).\n",
    "3) Entropy\n",
    "I'm looking to maximize the entropy while not assuming that the features are conditionally independent. In other words, the probability of a woman being pregnant would be higher given that she buys both vitamins and large amounts of sanitary supplies rather than that in the case where she buys just the vitamins. Also, as we have the testable information (training set collected at Target) we can have the probability distribution that maximizes the information entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "III Choosing The Appropriate Model:\n",
    "The appropriate classifiers we can choose from for predicting a woman is pregnant or not in this scenario are logistic regression, decision tree and support vector machines. We can model using a logistic regression as it satisfies all the above attributes. Also, multi-collinearity can be dealt with L2 regularization in case of a logistic regression.\n",
    "Decision trees, on the other hand, is based on a greedy algorithm which tends to make a decision at each step rather than looking at the bigger picture. For example, maternity wear could be a good feature to start the decision tree with. But, a similar concrete decision about pregnancy cannot be made if a woman buys a good body lotion. It's not unusual for women to buy good amounts of lotion even when she is not pregnant. This might result in not selecting the best possible tree (as a whole) as the tree tends to grow and also could result in a highly biased model.\n",
    "By choosing the logistic regression as our baseline model we can improve the performance further by adding an SVM. SVMs can overcome the disadvantage of logistic regression in case of non-linear interaction between the features. \n",
    "Hence, I would build my baseline model on logistic regression and include SVMs for boosting the performance above the vanilla performance.\n"

    "### Part 2: Exploring data in the command line\n",
    "For this part we will be using the data file located in `\"advertising_events.csv\"`. This file consists of records that pertain to some online advertising events on a given day. There are 4 comma separated columns in this order: `userid`, `timestamp`, `domain`, and `action`. These fields are of type `int`, `int`, `string`, and `int` respectively. Answer the following questions using Linux/Unix bash commands. All questions can be answered in one line (sometimes, with pipes)! Some questions will have many possible solutions. Don't forget that in IPython notebooks you must prefix all bash commands with an exclamation point, i.e. `\"!command arguments\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hints: You can experiment with whatever you want in the notebook and then delete things to construct your answer later.  You can also use ssh to use the actual bash shell in your terminal and then just paste your answers here. Recall that once you enter the \"!\" then filename completion should work. Also, these are standard data exploration commands that are quick and easy to use in a terminal or in the notebook. We don't cover command line operations formally in this class, but these are worth learning (and thus are part of the HW). Be resourceful. Use whatever online cheat sheets or Stackoverflow to answer the question.]"
